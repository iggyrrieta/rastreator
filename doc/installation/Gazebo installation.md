# Gazebo installation

Gazebo last version is 11, but `ros` and `ros2` only works with version 9:

As seen on [ros2 requirements](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#foxy-fitzroy-may-2020-may-2023) the foxy distribution works on Ubuntu Focal (also MacOS y Windows10) and Gazebo11

```bash
sudo apt install gazebo11
```



### Install gazebo_ros_pkgs

```bash
sudo apt install ros-foxy-gazebo-ros-pkgs
```
