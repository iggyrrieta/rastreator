# Local variables for ROS2 and Gazebo

`ROS2` framework is based on `CMake`. It means all changes need a compilation to work. As we can have multiple `ROS2` environments it is a good method to create local variables pointing to your working environment, this way all changes will be applied when running a new terminal.  

`ROS2` has different local variables that can be set also from the `~/.bashrc` file to get your environment up and running every time you run a new terminal.

Same way `Gazebo` has different local variables that can also be set from the `~/.bashrc` 



Open `~/.bashrc` with your favourite editor and insert the following:

```bash
